        <p>Hello there! My name is David and I am a 9 year old Tech and Math whiz. Even at my school my friends ask me for help at the computer lab or some times when we are taking a test they even sneak over to my desk to ask me for help, so much for keeping that a secret... But since I told you I was a whiz at high tech stuff I learnd to make my own website!! Also my brother is 19 and ALSO has his own website it is called <a href="http://brian-shi.com">brian-shi.com</a>.</p>
