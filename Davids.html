        <p>Hello there! My name is David and I am a 9 year old Tech and Math whiz. Even at my school my friends ask me for help at the computer lab or some times when we are taking a test they even sneak over to my desk to ask me for help, so much for keeping that a secret... But since I told you I was a whiz at high tech stuff I learnd to make my own website!! Also my brother is 19 and ALSO has his own website it is called <a href="http://brian-shi.com">brian-shi.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Now if your friend is going to bet if _________ is true or false just tell him to go to this website.
        Also if this website doesn't have the answers you want then send me an email at dezming62@outlook.com. {I am 9 so I don't have any facebook or twitter and stuff like that.} To get started click any of the links below to explore more about this website!<p>

   		<p> The answer to "Can Plants Think" is yes! This is because many people think that plants are nature and that is true but it also means we are to nature, and we can think! So how can plants not think and still be alive? So many scientist had been thinking about this question. So they started dropping a "fern" leaf down from 15 cenimeters repeating this process and each time the "fern" kept doing the same thing curling up into a ball like shape put on the 5 time it didn't! That is because it remembered it was the same height and it was harmless. This proves that plants CAN think!!</p>

        <p>Cats "purrr" when they're either mad, dissapointed, or happy. But the reason is still unknown for why cats purrr. But since I told you that when ever you are walking down the street and say "What a nice cat you have!" and then then they say "I listin to there purr to help me know what they want." You can tell them that's impossible...

        <p>LAB mice actually don't bite which I think is VERY interesting. This is because usally people just tame the mice and that is all, but taming them doesn't mean they don't bite! But only the wild mice bite. {Inculding the mice that live in your home, they too bite!} But aparently they TRAIN they to be gentle after they find them.<p>
